# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object
In this lesson, we dive deeper into the object concept of Python

# General Objectives
At the end of the lesson, we were able to:

- Define an object
- Identify the difference between a class and an object or instance
- State the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- Define a reference
- Explain an assignment
- State the meaning of an alias
- Determine if two variables are identical
- Determined if two variables are linked to the same object
